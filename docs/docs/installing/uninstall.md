If you want to uninstall SchemaHero from your cluster, the easiest method is to use the [install](https://schemahero.io/cli/kubectl/install/) command to generate the YAML and pass that to `kubectl delete`:

```shell
kubectl schemahero install --yaml | kubectl delete -f -
```

## Manually Uninstalling

To manually uninstall SchemaHero:

First, delete the CRDs:

```shell
kubectl delete crd databases.databases.schemahero.io
kubectl delete crd tables.schemas.schemahero.io
kubectl delete crd migrations.schemas.schemahero.io
```

Finally, delete the SchemaHero namespace:
