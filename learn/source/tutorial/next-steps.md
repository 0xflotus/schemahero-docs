Now that we've seen the basics of SchemaHero, you are ready to take the next steps and start using SchemaHero to manage your database schema migrations.

SchemaHero has a lot of capabilities that weren't covered in this introductory tutorial, so we encourage you to read the docs and join the community.

## Documentation

The full documentation to SchemaHero is at [schemahero.io/docs](https://schemahero.io/docs).
A good next step is to head over and explore the docs for additional questions and use cases.

## Migrating to SchemaHero

If you have an existing database that you'd like to start managing with SchemaHero, check out out [migrating to SchemaHero](https://schemahero.io/docs/advanced/migrating/) doc to get started.

## Community

The SchemaHero community is in the [#schemahero channel in Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/channels/schemahero) or active in the [github.com/schemahero/schemahero](https://github.com/schemahero/schemahero) repo.
Join us in Slack or open issues in the repo if you have questions.

## Cleaning Up

To remove the tutorial resources from your Kubernetes cluster, you can simply delete the `schemahero-tutorial` namespace:

```shell
kubectl delete ns schemahero-tutorial
```

If you'd like to also remove SchemaHero from your cluster, read the [uninstall docs](https://schemahero.io/docs/installing/uninstall/).
