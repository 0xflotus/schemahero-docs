We've gone through the basic of SchemaHero by deploying a database, creating a schema and then editing the schema. SchemaHero can do a lot more, including run simple migrations, manage tables and migrations that depend on each other and more.

This tutorial should continue to expand with more use cases. For now, try experimenting with it, and open an issue on [github.com/schemahero/schemahero](https://github.com/schemahero/schemahero) if run into problems or have questions!
