This tutorial will walk you through deploying SchemaHero and a sample database. It will allow you to use SchemaHero to modify the schema of the sample database.

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

1. A Kubernetes cluster with kubectl access. 
If you don't have one for testing, consider [KiND](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind), [K3S](https://k3s.io) or [kURL](https://kurl.sh).
2. Basic knowledge about database schemas. 
This toturial uses Postgres, so Postgres experience is recommended.
