title: Install SchemaHero
description: Install SchemaHero

To start, you'll need to have the SchemaHero `kubectl` plugin installed on your local workstation.
Assuming you already have `kubectl`, install [krew](https://krew.dev) and then install SchemaHero by running:

```shell
kubectl krew install schemahero
```

(Full installation instructions can be found in the Client section of the [installation documentation](/docs/installing/kubectl/#client)).
