If you are looking to get started contributing to SchemaHero, you are in the right place.

We have a couple of guides here to help you find your way.

## How we work

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/schemahero/schemahero/issues) to track bug reports, enhancements and other questions. 
We label the issues to help everyone know the status of the issue.
If you want to get started and need some ideas, take a look at the [good first issues](https://github.com/schemahero/schemahero/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or issues labels with [help wanted](https://github.com/schemahero/schemahero/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
We also welcome GitHub issues with requests and questions.

If you want to contribute, create a [pull request](https://github.com/schemahero/schemahero/pulls) with the change. 
We recommend creating an issue before a pull request to discuss the change, and referencing the issue in a pull request comment.

Be sure to follow the [SchemaHero code of conduct](https://github.com/schemahero/schemahero/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in pull requests, issues, and everywhere in the SchemaHero ecosystem.
