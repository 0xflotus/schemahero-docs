SchemaHero is an early project and there's a lot to do.
Our roadmap is designed to add compatibility with existing infrastructure and systems in order to create additional use cases and get feedback and adoption of SchemaHero in various environments.

The detailed SchemaHero roadmap is maintained in the [Roadmap project](https://github.com/schemahero/schemahero/projects/2) in the SchemaHero GitHub repo.

## Short Term Roadmap

The short term roadmap (6-12 months) is focused on increasing compatibility between SchemaHero and various production environments.
The goals of this period of time is to see SchemaHero adopted in more environments and identifying issues that prevent use of SchemaHero to manage a database schema.
